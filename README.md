# 👻 Supernatural Classification Project

## 📄 Overview
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to identify different supernatural entities based on structured features. It’s a fun and creative way to showcase model selection, performance tuning, and visualization in a multi-class classification setting.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## 🧪 ML Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding, scaling)
- Model Training:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
- Performance Evaluation:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Loaded and cleaned structured dataset
2. Visualized feature distributions
3. Applied different classification algorithms
4. Compared models using evaluation metrics

## 🧾 Sample Output
> Include screenshots from the notebook like confusion matrix or accuracy plot
